			<p style = "text-align: left;"> 
				Hi, my name is Wesley Chen and I am a fourth year Computer Engineering student at Toronto Metropolitan University 
				with a passion for both hardware and software. I am interested in mathematics, digital systems, algorithms,
				software development, and signal processing. Throughout my education, I've become experienced in such areas and  
				I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my insights. I decided to learn HTML and CSS from scratch to create 
				this personal website for fun as I've been interested in web development. I'm looking to rework or add more
				features and projects in the future to enhance its quality as I learn more. 
			<br><br>
				As for my non-technical side, I consider myself a team player who strives in a fast paced environment with strong
				organizational and time management skills. In my free time, I enjoy working out, playing video games, shopping,
				and going out for a walk.

						<p style="margin:0;"><div class = "gppdesc"><b> <h3>General-Purpose Processor (Academic) </h3><br></b>
							A simple General-Purpose Processor implemented in VHDL and Quartus II.
							It includes an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) which takes inputs from two storage units, a control unit,
				 			and outputs its result in a seven segment display unit. The ALU performs arithmetical and logical functions based
				 			on its op-code which is taken from the control unit. The control unit consists of a FSM (Finite State Machine)
							and a 4:16 decoder; the FSM cycles through 9 different states while the 4:16 decoder decodes the current state of
							the FSM to be read as an op-code for the ALU. Latches are used as the storage units which temporarily stores 8-bit
							inputs that is sent to the ALU every clock cycle. The final design of the General-Purpose Processor was simulated 
							and verified  with a functional waveform. This course was taken during the pandemic, so unfortunately it wasn't 
							possible to implement the processor in an FPGA board.

						<p style="margin:0;"><div class = "javafxdesc"><b> <h3>JavaFX Application (Academic) </h3><br> </b> 
							A bookstore GUI application developed in JavaFX with a group of 3. This was developed with usages of software 
							design patterns such as the Singleton and State Design Patterns. The application authenticates two different user
							login types, Owner and Customer. When the Owner is logged in, the application grants access to adding and deleting 
							book listings, registering and deleting customers from the customers list. The Owner's login was implemented 
							with the Singleton Design Pattern as there can only be one Owner. When a Customer is logged in, the application
							displays their name, points, and status and grants access to purchasing books. Customers can choose to purchase 
							with cash or with both points and cash. After the transaction, the customer is rewarded with points which may be 
							redeemed in future transactions to deduct the total cost. Additionally, each customer has their respective 
							statuses, depending on their current amount of points. The status system was implemented with the State Design 
							Pattern. Upon closure of the application, the customer information and book listings are dynamically stored or 
							updated in a text file so that the next time the application is launched, the data is read from the text file.
